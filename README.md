# hello-world

Hello!

I'm Mike. I've been a product manager for over 5 years, and a product manager for digital products for just over a year and a half. 
This is my first time getting hands-on with GitHub, but I hope you won't be discouraged by that- I'm eager to learn.
I believe Product Management's role within organizations is to be an effective and collaborative partner to Development.

Nothing improves without open communication and feedback. Always be willing to share ideas, suggestions, or criticisms.
